## Welcome
I am an IT system administrator in the field of network and IT security with a strong interest in research. My main responsibilities in my 10+ years of professional experience have been in the area of system and network administration as well as infrastructure monitoring.  
Furthermore, I completed an extra-occupational Bachelor's degree program in Business Informatics and subsequently earned my Master's degree in Applied IT Security in a distance learning program.
