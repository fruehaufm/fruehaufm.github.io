## Welcome
I am an IT system administrator in the field of network and IT security with a strong interest in research. My main professional responsibilities so far have been in the area of system and network administration as well as infrastructure monitoring.  
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics in an extra-occupational program for working professionals and subsequently earned my Master's degree in Applied IT Security in a distance learning program.
